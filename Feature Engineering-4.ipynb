    "\n",
    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format that can be easily understood and processed by machine learning algorithms. It is useful in data science because most machine learning algorithms require numerical input, and encoding ensures that categorical data can be used effectively without introducing bias or errors.\n"

    "Nominal encoding is a method of encoding categorical variables that do not have an inherent order or ranking. An example is encoding the colors of cars (red, blue, green) into numerical values (e.g., red = 1, blue = 2, green = 3). This can be used in a car sales dataset where the color of the car might influence the sales price.\n",
